In the WP dashboard if you mouse over posts you'll see "Categories" and that will lead you to the categories page.

On that page you can see all the categories in the right column and in the left you can add new categories. To add a new category you need to create a name for it in the "Name" field and you should assign a "Parent" to it (if you don't assign a parent the category will be on the same level as "Primary" and "Secondary").

_Dropdown for Parent selection._

If the category is a focus area then its parent would be "Focus Area". If you'd like to add a slug yourself you can do that, but if you add a category and leave that field empty, it'll just generate one for you automatically.

So if you want to edit an an existing category you can just find it in the large column on the right and click on it.


If you have a hard time finding it, you can search for the category using the field in the top-right corner,

which will then display the appropriate results.

On the editing page for a category, you'll see that you can change the name and slug of a category,

and you can assign it to a different parent.

In the screenshot example what I did is change "Method" to "Field" and then I moved it from being a primary category to being a secondary category.

_Selecting Secondary as the parent._

Once those changes are made, you can click Update and it'll take effect.
